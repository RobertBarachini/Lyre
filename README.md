# Lyre - a more transparent music app.

## Build
Open the solution in Visual Studio and add the following libraries using NuGet:
* Newtonsoft.Json
* taglib (TagLib#)
Other resources should be downloaded via the program itself.

## Usage
Copy and paste any string containing Youtube links into the main form area. The downloads should start automatically. Maximum concurrent downloads are limited to 3 (for performance reasons).

## The idea
I have grown tired of other apps that do not fit my taste or ideas for various reasons (the main being infestation with ads and being all around 'sketchy'). 

My ultimate goal is to create an open-source all-in-one music app. The end product will consist of content downloaders, automatic ID3 tagging, music library and an advanced media player. The final app should play nicely with all music lovers, DJs and data hoarders. 

If you have any further questions or suggestions please do not hesitate to contact me. I am always ready to learn more!
